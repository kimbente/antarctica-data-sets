# Antarctic data sets
Overview of available data sets under the public domains which may be suitable for translational data science projects within Antarctic research. 

## Data providers

## Data by location of interest

### Little Dome C

This area is of particular interest to paleoclimatology researchers. A current project is the [Million year ice core project](https://www.antarctica.gov.au/science/climate-processes-and-change/antarctic-palaeoclimate/million-year-ice-core/) led by the Australian Antarctic Division. Furthermore there is the [Beyond EPICA (European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica) project](https://www.beyondepica.eu/en/) leb by European researchs.

### Ross Ice Sheet

* [ROSETTA-Ice](https://pgg.ldeo.columbia.edu/data/rosetta-ice) is an airborne geophysical survey of the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica. The survey was conducted throughout three Antarctic seasons (2015 - 2016, 2016 - 2017, and 2017 - 2018). The instruments deployed include the IcePod, ZLS Gravimeter, DgS Gravimeter, and iMAR Gravimeter
* [SWAIS 2C](https://www.antarcticanz.govt.nz/media/news/drilling-into-antarcticas-past-to-see-our-future) project by Antarctica New Zealand. The Antarctic research project will investigate the sensitivity of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet to global warming of 2Â°C (SWAIS 2C) by retrieving sediment from the depths in a bid to find out how the ice behaved when global temperatures were as warm as those expected in the coming decades.
